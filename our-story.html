            The story of Oblect AI is nothing short of revolutionary. During the COVID Pandemic, Luca Vassallo knew he wanted to start a business but had no ideas. He needed inspiratin. One day in 7th grade, he stumbled across an article in bed about how AI was going to take over the world, and so he got an idea. What if he could make a platform where AI could generate movies and television shows. He started to do research for this, but ultimately drifted apart from this due to external factors. In 9th grade, this idea resurfaced, and he knew that he had to do it. He started taking Computer Science courses and in his sophomore year dropped out of Latin to focus on business. In his junior year he paired up with Liam Kelly, and the two shared ideas and formed plans.
